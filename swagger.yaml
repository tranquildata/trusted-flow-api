      summary: Creates or updates a user and their details
      description: |
        This routine creates a "user" such that data can be associated, relationships can be formed, and
        personalized decisions can be made. A user may be created or updated for many reasons, but the four
        most common flows are:
        1. A person comes to the platform on their own to create an account as a "first-party", and after that
           user is created, platform terms will be accepted so that the user may interact with the platform
        2. A user comes to the platform through an employer, partner, health plan, etc., to create an account
           "as a first-party" (as above) that also has a contractual relationship
        3. A third-party contract leads to data-exchange, such that users are created in association with
           the data that is onboarded, even though those users are not themselves interacting with the platform
        4. A guardian comes to the platform to support their child, and while they are not users of the
           platform themselves they must tracked as a user to establish the relationship and associated rights
        
        The set of `attributes` may contain arbitrary values, but the following are used in evaluating platform
        configuration:
        * `dob` represents the date of birth used in overrides and in determining if someone is treated as a
          child. The value is a string in ISO 8601 form like `2017-01-23` 
        * `location` represents the physical location used in overrides.

        A child is any user who has been connected to a guardian via the [upsertGuardian()](#api-User-upsertGuardian) call. Platform
        configuration supports setting a threshold age, above which a user is never considered a child. If
        a given user has a `dob` attribute that means they are older than the threshold, then they will
        never be returned by this routine.

  /user/consent:

      summary: Updates the set of discretionary consents for a given user
      description: |
        This routine creates or updates the set of discretionary consents, granted by a given user, as governed
        by platform terms. Once a user has agreed to terms, they may consent to share their data via any of three mechanisms:
        1. *Platform Opt-Ins* grant access to a fixed set of categories of the user's data, for use on the platform or sharing
            for platform purposes, in exchange for some stated value back to the user. A common example would be a user opting-in
            to marketing emails in-exchange for discounts or early access.
        2. *Affirmative Consents* allow a user to share under one or more relationships, where some other party has requested
            specific categories but the user is free to share all or a subset of those categories. Common examples would be sharing
            between multiple applications from the same company, or sharing data with a research group in-exchange for feedback to the user.
        3. *Personal Sharing* allows a user to share categories of their choice with any individual. Common examples would be sharing
            with a family member or a friend.

        At any point a user may change the scope of their consents. A call to this routine that names a specific consent with no
        categories will revoke that consent relationship.

        This routine is used to establish or update a relationship between a guardian and a child. Both users must already exist. Any
        provided controls will be merged with preferences from other guardians. For instance, if a child has two guardians, and each guardian
        explicitly disallows sharing with a different third-party, then a call to [getChildren()](#api-User-getChildren) for either guardian
        will result in a child that has both third-parties disabled.

  /user/status:

    get:
      tags:
        - user
      summary: Returns the status of the given user, including whether they need to re-accept platform terms
      description: |
        This routine is used to discover when the given user last accepted platform terms and whether they need
        to accept the latest terms, typically because something that applies to this user has been added or was
        changed "expansively." If the user exists but is not a first-party user who has ever accepted terms,
        such as a identity created through a third-party exchange or a guardian who is not a user of the platform,
        then no status is returned.

        A common flow is to call this routine whenever a user logs in to the platform. If the routine returns `200`
        and the value of `reacceptRequired` is true, then the next step is get the personal terms for the user,
        ask the user to accept the new terms, and then record that via [acceptTerms()](#api-User-acceptTerms).
        Once the new terms have been accepted, the status will go back to returning false until there is something
        new for the user to accept.

      summary: Returns the personalized terms that apply to a given, existing user
      description: >
        This routine returns the subset of platform terms that specifically apply to the identified user.
        The typical flow is that when a user first creates an account, personal terms are retrieved via
        the [getContextualTerms()](#api-User-getContextualTerms) routine to show a user what they are accepting.
        Once that user is created, then any further need to get the personal set (e.g., to display a "privacy
        nutrition label" to a user, or to use when new terms must be accepted) is done through this routine.

        This routine is used to tell Tranquil Data that the identified user has accepted the current
        platform terms. It is up to the caller to ensure either that the user's personal terms have been
        shown to the user, or some process was run leading the user to accept terms. Typically this
        routine needs to be called when a user is first created, and subsequently whenever a call to
        [getStatus()](#api-User-getStatus) says that the user need to accept new terms.
        
        The acceptor property is used only if someone other than the identified user is accepting rights
        for that user. One common example is when guardians review and accept terms on behalf of their
        children.

      description: >
        This routine is used to generate a preview of user terms based upon the user's context, without requiring an existing user
        in the system. This routine returns the subset of platform terms that specifically apply to the user context, and is
        intended for use early in onboarding so that a preview of terms can be presented to a potential user without having to delete
        user state if that user declines. If the user proceeds, then the rest of the onboarding flow should continue (e.g. create a user,
        accept terms, and configure any discretionary consents). This routine may also be used to generate previews for the platform 
        itself to verify that policy terms match what is expected and for internal debugging and development.

        This routine is used to generate a preview of user terms based upon provided context values without requiring an existing user
        in the system. This routine returns the subset of platform terms that specifically apply to the provided user context, and is
        intended for use early in onboarding so that a preview of terms can be presented to a potential user without having to delete
        user state if that user declines. If the user proceeds, then the rest of the onboarding flow should continue (e.g. create a user,
        accept terms, and configure any discretionary consents). This routine may also be used to generate previews for the platform 
        itself to verify that policy terms match what is expected and for internal debugging and development.

      summary: Redact a single document for a stated purpose, removing any fields (or entire records) that are not allowed.
      description: |
        This routine takes a supported document format and redacts it for responsible use based on the stated purpose. A
        receipt is returned immediately which includes details about how to check on the redaction process and download the
        prepared version of the document when the process is done. The document is assumed to contain one or more records,
        each of which is evaluated independently.
        
        The specified `mappingGroup` (or the default group, if no group is named) is used to map record fields to their associated
        categories. If a given record has an associated user (as identified via the `resourceContext` flag specified when calling
        [upsertMappingGroup()](#api-Mapping-upsertMappingGroup)) then that user's context will be used in evaluation. As a
        result, the rationale for the decision made about any given record, and the subsequent fields that are redacted,
        may change with each given record. Any field in a record that is not defined in the chosen `mappingGroup` will
        be redacted in the final document.

        For documents of type `text/csv`, the content must be a standard CSV document in text form that starts with a single
        "header" line naming all of the fields in the document. Each of the following rows is treated as a single `record` and
        evaluated independently. Both the header row and all following record rows must be comma-separated.

        For documents of type `application/json` the document will be treated as a single `record`, unless it is formatted as a
        JSON Lines document, in which case each line will be treated as a single `record` and evaluated independently.

        For documents of type `application/xml` the document will be treated as a single `record`.

        For documents of type `application/fhir+json` or `application/fhir+xml` the document will be treated as a single `record`,
        unless the provided resource is a standard FHIR `bundle`, in which case each resource will be treated as a single `record`
        and evaluated independently.

        For documents of type application/octet-stream the service will attempt to resolve the magic number and see if the
        contents represent a Parquet document.

          type: object
          description: >
            Some data formats spread the components of a property value across multiple record fields. In those cases you can specify
            the record fields with a join value. The property value will be assembled by concatenating the values of the matched fields
            listed in fieldNames, separated by the specified delimiter. If any field is missing, then the mapping does not match. For
            example, suppose the expected resource subject for a given record is 'Invoice/123'. That value isn't present in the record,
            but the record field 'type' has the value 'Invoice', and the record field 'identifier.id' has the value '1234'. With a
            recordJoinValue you can set 'fieldNames' to ['type', 'identifier.id'] and 'delimiter' to '/' to resolve the expected value.

        fieldMatchRules:
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            type: string
          description: >
            Specifies optional record-field matching constraints. If fieldMatchRules is empty, then the mapping is said to
            match if any record-field in the input matches the value of recordField. If non-empty, then each key in fieldMatchRules
            is interpreted as a record-field name. If a record has matching fields for every key, and if each value matches the
            value of the corresponding field in fieldMatchRules, only then is this mapping's recordField checked for a match. Use
            fieldMatchRules for situations where a required field has different names depending on other fields. For example in a
            system with 'user' and 'customer' records a `type` field is used to distinguish between them. For user records the
            user_id is in the field named `id` and the `type` field is "user". But for customer records, the user_id is in the field
            named `cust_id` when the `type` field has the value "customer". To handle this case, two mappings would be defined. One
            would have field match rules set to match `type` against "user" and the other would match `type` against "customer".
        tag:
          type: string
          description: >
            if non-empty, the value of tag is included in record context with the associated record. For example if a given record has
            an 'Address' field that held the user's address, that could be tagged with the value 'PII'. The actual address wouldn't be
            included in-context, just the tag. If multiple fields with the same tag in a given record match, only a single tag value
            will be set. This is useful for acting on types of data that are present or absent.
        score:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Specifies a score value that this field will carry. The scores of all matching fields in a record are summed up to produce
            a total score for that record. This is useful for applying thresholding or weighting.
